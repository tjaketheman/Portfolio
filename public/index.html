  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I just recently began attending Helio Training Full-Stack Bootcamp, and will be graduating in May.  
    I have an Associate's degree in General Studies
    along with hundreds of hours fixing my computer at home.  My hobbies include 
    camping, white-water rafting, and playing games.  I have worked many different 
    places...
    </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My goal is to continue my own education and learn as much about Computer Science
        as I can.  To use the skills I gain to improve the company in whatever way I can.
        To make a career in this field, I can't be happy with stagnation, I want to be able to
        progress and better myself in the process.
    </p>
